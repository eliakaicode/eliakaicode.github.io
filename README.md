		<h1>P is for Praha</h1>
		<h4>Published on: September 11th, 2019</h4>

		<p>This June I went to the Czech Republic for the first time. On a whim my friends and I booked a trip to Prague - or Praha. The old city blew our minds. The architecture. The people. The doughy ice creams cones covered in sugar and chocolate syrup. Prague exceeded my expectations.</p>

		<p>One of my favorite parts of my trip to Prague was walking across the Charles Bridge and exploring the old town on the other side. After filing past the lines of tourists and tempting gelato vendors, we made our first stop at Lennon Wall, a wall covered in the lyrics of John Lennon's song 'Imagine' and messages of peace nad equality. Next, my friends and I explored the rest of the town, stopping in a park, a hip czech shop, and a garden with some resident peacocks. It felt like I was living in a little fairytale for a day.</p>
