	<h2>Welcome to my Photo Gallery</h2>
<div class="dog margin">
	<p>I began taking photos when I was just a wee little 12 year old starting to discover the online world of social media. I was inspired by Tumblr and Instagram and aspired to have my own photography account. I never did that. But I did take my father's DSLR camera and practiced photography any chance I could. From festivals, family gatherings, vactions, and portrait sessions with my dog, I immersed myself in photography, not really caring whether I was good or not.<p>

	<p>In high school I decided to take that passion a step further, and took photography classes throughout my time there. I learned a lot about how to edit photos, composition, using PhotoShop, and finding the beauty in every day life. I also learned how to use a manual and automatic film camera. This is something I am so grateful to know because it help me discover that film is defintely one of my favorite mediums. In my senior year I decided to overcome my own self conciousness and apply to be a photographer for my school's newspaper, Silver Chips. I was accepted quickly, and welcomed into the world of photojournalism. I learned so much from this experience and created work that I am still so proud of. The mix of journalism and photography definitely influenced my decision to study Journalism + Design at The New School and I hope to continue to add to this photo gallery throughout my time studying here.</p>
