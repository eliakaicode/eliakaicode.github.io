		<h1>EuroTrip 2k19</h1>
		<h4 id="iguana">Published on: September 19th, 2019</h4>
		<p class="dog">This summer I flew across the Atlantic Ocean with my best friends. On a whim, we all booked flights to a summer excursion to Europe, planning a trip to Amsterdam and Prague. Our first stop was in Amsterdam to meet up with my good friend Antonia. She goes to school in Maastricht - Southern Holland- but in Europe everything is basically just a plane ride away.</p>
		<p class="dog"> Planning the trip took a lot of work, especially because during the months leading up to the trip, all of us were in school and busy with finals. Our itinerary was a bit all over the place and we definitely did get lost a few times, but we ended up loving Amsterdam because of that. We were able to see the Dutch city in a different way than most tourists.</p>

		<h1>P is for Praha</h1>
		<h4 id="iguana">Published on: September 11th, 2019</h4>

		<p class="dog">This June I went to the Czech Republic for the first time. On a whim my friends and I booked a trip to Prague - or Praha. The old city blew our minds. The architecture. The people. The doughy chimney cakes covered in cinamon-sugar and topped with ice cream and chocolate syrup. Prague exceeded my expectations.</p>

		<p class="dog">One of my favorite parts of my trip to Prague was walking across the Charles Bridge and exploring the old town on the other side. After filing past the lines of tourists and tempting gelato vendors, we made our first stop at Lennon Wall, a wall covered in the lyrics of John Lennon's song 'Imagine' and messages of peace nad equality. Next, my friends and I explored the rest of the town, stopping in a park, a hip czech shop, and a garden with some resident peacocks. It felt like I was living in a little fairytale for a day.</p>
