	<p>I am currently a Sophomore studying Journalism + Design at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at the New School. While at The New School I plan to complete two minors: Interdisciplinary Science and Hispanic Studies. So far my time as a student in New York City has been an amazing learning experience and transition period in my life. Although I am a lover of nature, my heart does have room for the concrete and glass cityscape of NYC. I find inspirations and connections to my studies everywhere. I plan to use this self-coded website as an outlet for my creative pieces, writing, and general blog posts.</p>

	<p>From my studies, I hope to discover a way in which to better communicate the risks and science behind climate change. I believe that climate change is the largest threat to not only my future, but the future of the generations after me. There is not a day that goes by where I do not think about how our planet is suffering from human activity. With my writing and knowledge of science I hope to write about climate change in a way that informs, incites action, and is easily understandable.</p>

	<p>I am so appreciative to be able to go to a university which is on the forefront of social justic issues, climate change, and the arts. The academic freedom that I have at the New School has allowed me to pursue a mix of fields that interest me rather than just one field. I am a multi-faceted person who is very passionate about social justice, science, and my goal in life is to be able to mesh those all together for my career.</p>
